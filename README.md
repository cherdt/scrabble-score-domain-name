# Scrabble Scores for DGAs

An exploration of Domain-Generating Algorithm (DGA) domains. I used the Majestic Million as a control.

This code was used in the analysis presented in [Identifying DGA Domains Using Scrabble Scores: A Naive Approach](http://osric.com/chris/accidental-developer/2018/12/identifying-dga-domains-using-scrabble-scores-a-naive-approach/)

## How to compile
`make`

## How to use it
`echo example.com | ./score`

or

`./score <dga_list`
